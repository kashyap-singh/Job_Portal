# Job_Portal

The website will allow job seekers to find various opportunities based on
their skill set. There will be multiple domains (categories) and an
organization can post a job in any category. Organizations can check the
list of jobs all the jobs they have posted which can be filtered by date
ascending/descending as well as vacancy filled in each of them.
Organizations can also check for all new applicants who have applied for
the jobs & select them accordingly.


A Job seeker can check all the jobs available & also check jobs for a given
domain (category). Jobs can be filtered by recently added, number of
vacancies available & CTC. Job seekers must be logged in to apply for a
job & once selected, should not be able to apply for new jobs. Job seeker
profile must list all the jobs they have applied to but once they are selected
then only the selected job should be presented.
